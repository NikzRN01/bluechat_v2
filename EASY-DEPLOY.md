- ✅ **Live chat application** accessible worldwide
- ✅ **WhatsApp/Instagram inspired UI**
- ✅ **Real-time messaging** with WebSockets
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly** responsive design
- ✅ **HTTPS** enabled automatically

## 📱 Testing Your Live App

1. **Open your deployment URL**
2. **Create a username** and join a room
